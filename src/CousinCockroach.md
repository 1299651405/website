I just saw a cockroach in my kitchen.
The usual feelings swept through me.
First, hope that it was a bit of cockroach shaped debris.
Second, it was at least another sort of insect. 
Third, fear and disgust, I was a fascist and the cockroach was a cockroach.
I tried to kill it with a brush, I failed.
I thought, sardonically, that me and the cockroach were related, somehow.
How could I be related to a stupid, verminous, insect?

But of course I am.
The cockroach and I have a common ancestor, and we are both animals that reproduce sexually, so we have the same grandparents, somewhere down the line.
We are nth cousins, m times removed.
What is m, and what is n?

n is the amount of generations you have to go back to find a common ancestor, + 1.
1st cousin -> 2 generations (grandparent)
2nd cousin -> 3 generations (great-grandparent)

m is the offset, the difference in the number of genertaions beteen the two curious candiadates.
Cockroachs have a far shorter lifespan than mammals, so we shall be cousins many time removed. While there might be proportionally far less difference between me an a whale.

So I only need to find the 
# Phylogeny

Common ancestor maybe 560-600 mya
cockroaches emerge 300-350 mya
(the cockroach order contains termites, and is adjacent to the mantis order)


cockroach lifespan is a yr,

What is a cousin?




When I was a quite young, maybe 10, I felt a lump under my vest, I brushed it out, expecting it to be a piece of food, or some other inanimate, cockroach sized object.
But as the black object fell from my person, it sprouted legs

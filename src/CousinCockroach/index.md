title: My Cousin, the Cockroach

I just saw a cockroach in my kitchen.
Initially, I hoped I was looking at a bit of cockroach shaped debris -- or at least some other sort of insect.
Then, afraid and disgusted, I had to face the fact I had 

And then I was struck by the fact I was related to the cockroach. Obviously I would not expect to find any members of the cockroach clan in old census data or family records, but we are both bilaterally symmetrical animals that reproduce sexually, we are hardly alien. If you go back far enough we have a common ancestor, making us very distant cousins.

I tried to squash it with a broom, but I was too slow, the cockroach scuttled under a cupboard. Feeling ambivalent about my failure, I wondered if our relationship could be quantified.

## Ancestry

![this](familytree.webp)

From this chart it should be obvious that the cockroach will be some sort of xth cousin y times removed.

Within human populations things a more complicated. If you live on an island with a small population and few visitors, you may have no choice but marry your second cousin. That second cousin could also be your fourth cousin on your mothers side. The islands family trees are all woven together. Even in large populations this is still the case, but with many more degrees of separation. 

## Phylogentic tree

Speciation occurs when a species splits into two populations that stop interbreeding with each other. For us and cockroaches this happened a long time ago.

This does simplify my original question, in a way.
As there is no interbreeding between us an cockroaches, our phylogentic strands are clearly separated from each other.
The question now becomes, how many generations precede me and how many precede the cockroach since we went our separate ways in the tree of life.

We will have to take a few liberties.

Cockroaches are an ancient insect, they are sucessful generalists and have remained relatively unchanged sinc there inception, we can use modern data and extrapolate backwards.

Humans have a more complex prehistory, throughout the mezozoic we were shrew like animals, living in the shaodw of the dinosaurs. After the K-Pg extiction we were early primates, we diverged from the lemurs, then the monkeys, gibbons, oragutangs, gorillas, chimpanzees and finally the other hominids.

Cockroaches, being insects, split from humans at 560 mya.
We are both part of Nephrozoa, and our last common ancestor (or great-great-...-great-great grandparents) was probably some sort of worm.

After that we split from star fish at 560 mya, became chordates at 540 mya, then vertebrates at 525 mya, develped a jaw at 460 mya, bones at 430 mya, tetrapods at 340 mya, split from reptiles at 320 mya, developed a placenta at 90 mya ...

One intersting thing you see exploring mammal taxonomy is the prevalnce of things that look like shrews but aren't. Elephants are closely related to the elephant shrew. Tree shrews are more colosely related to primates that they are to shrews. Shrews themselves seem like tey should be a sort of reodent, but they arent, more closely related to moles and hedgehogs.

Invertebrates are more difficult to make assured statements about because they are less represented on the fossil record.




## Model



What data do we have that will help us work out the generation time of long extint animals?
I had a look around for an apropiate database, and settled on AnAge. It can be downloaded as a TSV, and seems to be the most recent.

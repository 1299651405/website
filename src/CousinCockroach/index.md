I just saw a cockroach in my kitchen.
Initially, I hoped I was looking at a bit of cockroach shaped debris -- or at least some other sort of insect.
Then, afraid and disgusted, I had to face the fact I had 

And then I was struck by the fact I was related to the cockroach. Obviously I would not expect to find any members of the cockroach clan in old census data or family records, but we are both bilaterally symmetrical animals that reproduce sexually, we are hardly alien. If you go back far enough we have a common ancestor, making us very distant cousins.

I tried to squash it with a broom, but I was too slow, the cockroach scuttled under a cupboard. Feeling ambivalent about my failure, I wondered if our relationship could be quantified.

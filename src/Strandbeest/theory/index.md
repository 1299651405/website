# Spring

You might have done an expiriment in school with a spring, some weights and a ruler. If you did, you would have found that not only did the spring increase in length whenever another weight was added, but the increase in length was in proportion to the increase in weight. This is elastic deformation. If you kept adding weight you would get to a point where the spring didn't want to extend any further, and if you kept going still the spring would contort and eventually snap. This is plastic deformation, followed by failure. Generally we like to stick to elastic deformation, it is predictable and will only last as long as the load is applied, as opposed to less predictable and permanant.
